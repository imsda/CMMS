# HOW-TO: Club Director Volunteer Guide

This guide is for Club Directors managing rosters and Camporee registration in CMMS.

---

## 1) Sign in and open Director Dashboard

1. Go to CMMS login.
2. Sign in with your director account.
3. Open **Director Dashboard**.

If you cannot access director pages, ask Conference Admin to confirm your account role is `CLUB_DIRECTOR` and linked to your club.

---

## 2) Run yearly roster rollover

Each new club year, copy active members from last year into the new year roster.

Go to **Director → Roster**.

If no active roster exists for the current year, you will see **Start yearly rollover**.

### Steps

1. Review that the previous year shown is correct.
2. Click **Run [Current Year] Rollover**.
3. Wait for page refresh.
4. Confirm new year shows as **Active**.

### What rollover does

- Creates a new active roster year for your club.
- Copies active members from prior year.
- Preserves last year’s records for history.

### After rollover (important)

Review every member and update:

- Age/date of birth
- Role changes
- Active/inactive status
- Medical and emergency contact info

---

## 3) Manage member data (medical/background checks)

From **Director → Roster**, use the roster table to add or edit members.

### Core member fields to maintain

- First name / Last name
- Member role
- Age at start (or date of birth)
- Gender (if used by your conference)
- Active toggle

### Medical and dietary data

Update as needed:

- Medical flags (allergy, condition, medicine considerations)
- Dietary restrictions
- Emergency contact name + phone

This information flows into event medical/dietary manifests.

### Background check tracking

For adult staff/volunteers, maintain:

- Background check date
- Cleared status

Keep these values current before major events.

## 4) Complete a Camporee registration

Go to **Director → Events → [Event]**.

### Recommended workflow

1. Read event dates, deadlines, and pricing.
2. Select roster attendees.
3. Complete all required dynamic form fields.
4. Review totals and submission data.
5. Submit registration.

### Tips for dynamic questions

- Required fields must be completed before submit.
- Some questions may ask for roster-linked selections.
- Multi-select answers appear as selectable options configured by Conference Admin.

### After submission

- Keep record of registration code (if shown).
- Reopen the event page to confirm status changed from draft to submitted.
- Coordinate payment according to conference process.

---

## 5) Assign members to classes (live capacities)

Go to **Director → Events → [Event] → Classes**.

### How class assignment works

- You can assign only attendees included in your event registration.
- Class seats are checked live by the system.
- If a class is full, assignment will be blocked.

### Best practices

- Assign early for high-demand classes.
- Re-check assignments near registration close.
- Keep alternates ready in case capacity changes.

## 6) Director monthly checklist

### Beginning of year

- Run roster rollover
- Review all member active statuses
- Update emergency contacts and medical flags
- Verify staff background checks

### Before Camporee registration opens

- Confirm roster is complete and current
- Pre-identify likely attendees
- Gather info needed for dynamic event fields

### Before registration closes

- Submit event registration
- Validate attendee list accuracy
- Complete class assignments

### Week before event

- Recheck attendee roster and class assignments
- Notify families of schedule and requirements
- Keep emergency data ready and accurate

## 7) Common director mistakes to avoid

- Forgetting to run yearly rollover before editing roster
- Leaving members active who are no longer participating
- Missing emergency contact details
- Submitting registration without reviewing required dynamic fields
- Waiting too long to assign classes with limited seats

---

## 8) When to contact Conference Admin

Contact Super Admin if you:

- Cannot access your club data
