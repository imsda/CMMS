# Club Director Quick-Start Guide

Welcome! This guide is written for volunteer **Club Directors** who need to maintain rosters and complete Camporee registration quickly.

---

## 1) Log in

1. Open the platform URL provided by your conference.
2. Click **Sign In**.
3. Enter your email and password.
4. After login, you should land in the **Club Director dashboard**.

If you cannot sign in, contact your conference admin to confirm your account and club membership are active.

---

## 2) Know your main navigation

As a Club Director, you will use three primary areas:

- **Dashboard**: Your starting page and event shortcuts.
- **Roster**: Manage this year’s members and annual rollover.
- **Event pages**: Register your club and attendees for Camporee.

---

## 3) Run the yearly roster rollover

Use this once per new club year.

1. Go to **Roster**.
2. Find the **Start yearly rollover** section.
3. Select the source year (last year’s roster).
4. Start rollover to create the new active year.
5. Review copied members and update statuses:
   - Keep continuing members active.
   - Mark graduates/archived members appropriately.
   - Add any new members who joined this year.

### Rollover tips

- Complete rollover **before** Camporee registration opens.
- Confirm spelling, ages, and member roles—these can affect class eligibility.
- Keep emergency and medical notes current for event safety.

---

## 4) Register your club for a Camporee

1. Open the relevant event from your dashboard/events list.
2. Review the event dates, location, and registration window.
3. Select attendees from your active roster.
4. Complete all required event questions.
5. Save/submit registration.
6. Verify the status changes from draft to submitted as expected.

### Important

- Only roster members in the active club year should be selected.
- Required form questions must be completed before final submission.
- If the registration window is closed, contact conference administration.

---

## 5) Assign attendees to classes (with live capacities)

After registration, go to the event’s **Classes** section.

1. Pick an attendee.
2. Review available class offerings.
3. Watch the **seats left** indicator in real time.
4. Assign classes while seats are available.
5. Repeat until each attendee has a complete schedule.

### Capacity best practices

- Assign high-demand classes first.
- If a class is full, select the next preferred option.
- Recheck final assignments before the registration deadline.

---

## 6) Day-of-event checklist

Before departure:

- Confirm all intended attendees are registered.
- Confirm class assignments are complete.
- Verify medical/emergency details for each attendee.
- Download/print any registration exports required by your conference.

---

## 7) Common issues and quick fixes

### “I can’t find a member during registration”
- Ensure the member exists in the **active** roster year.
- Ensure the member is marked active.

### “I can’t enroll into a class”
- The class may be at capacity.
- The attendee may not meet prerequisites (age/role/honors).
- The attendee must be part of your event registration.

### “My submission is still draft”
- Re-open the event form and complete missing required fields.
- Save/submit again and refresh the page.

## 8) When to contact conference support

Contact support/admin when:

- You cannot access your account.
- Your club assignment is incorrect.
- Event window dates need override.
- A roster or registration requires admin-level correction.
